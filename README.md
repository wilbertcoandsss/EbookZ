This app is Software Engineering Class Project that I made with my 4 other friends in the same classes. This application consists of Improved Electronic Book Web-Based Application that have so many features, such as buy books, read books, see transaction history, daily missions & rewards, and subscription.

This application itself has been through a lot of evaluating process and from the business value that have on it. So, we already consult this application with Entrepreneurship Expert Lecturer from my University to make this application even have more business value than we've ever had before.

It is built on Laravel Framework and MySQL databases.

Also, this project is rewarded as one of the best projects in my classes, really greatful for that and thanks to Ms Mei that give us rewards!
